## Demo scenarios

The Demo comes with a number of problem scenarios that you can enable via 
a [feature flag](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/demo/feature-flags/); please 
note that some of these are currently still under testing on our end. 

The following is a list of tutorials on how to navigate each scenario in
New Relic. 
* [Product Catalog failure](https://github.com/newrelic/opentelemetry-demo/blob/main/docs/demo-scenarios/product-catalog-failure.md)

More coming soon! 

**Note**: 
Since these are contrived issues, there isn't a lot of particularly useful information 
captured, but it does demonstrate how the error metrics captured are early indicators of these issues
and how they can affect the performance and reliability of your services. 

Using New Relic can help you quickly resolve issues by uncovering the root cause through 
correlated logs and traces, giving you detailed insights into what happened during a given problem. 

We are working on adding more detailed error messages and details to more effectively 
demonstrate how to troubleshoot the issues in New Relic.
